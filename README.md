# Climate_Risk_Children
Code and data to study the relationship between multidimensional child poverty and floods in Nigeria. 
Code file: climate_childrenV5.Rmd, includes a detailed description of the required datasets and all the steps in the data analysis.
Data files: Microdata_DHS_Apr2023, dhsgps_combined_sep22.csv, only the flooding data file is missing (too heavy) but can be downloaded from: https://global-flood-database.cloudtostreet.ai/

# Next Steps:
1) I haven't been able to download the flooding data on duration and existing watersheds. I emailed them but haven't heard back.
2) Add other flooding years
3) Add other DHS years
4) Explore a diff-in-diff design to compare differences in multidimensional poverty outcomes before and after the flooding and between those who were affected and those who didn't
5) Add LSMS data and study the effect of receiving cash transfers among those affected by flooding. Only select individuals affected by the flood and compare differences between those who got the cash transfers and those who didn't/
